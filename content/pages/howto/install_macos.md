Title: Install Gaphor in macOS

Install Gaphor on macOS using the [latest gaphor-macOS.dmg
installer](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases/download/1.1.0/gaphor-macOS-1.1.0.dmg)


Note: Sometimes launching the app the first time after installation fails due
to macOS security settings, please attempt to launch it a 2nd time if this
happens. Right click (Ctrl+click) on the icon to bring up the context menu and
open it from there.

Note: On MacOS Mojave you'll have to grand permission to run Gaphor via the System preferences
panel.
