Title: About

Gaphor is a UML modeling application written in Python. It is designed
to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a
fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture
drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects
of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.

Gaphor is designed around the following principles:

## Simple.
Gaphor is a simple and easy to use modeling tool for UML, we believe complexity
impedes a novice modeler's first steps. Only some basic knowledge of UML is required.

## Aimed at Beginners.
It is aimed at beginning modelers who want a simple and fast tool so that they
can focus on learning. The application should not bother the user every time
they do something non-UML-ish.

## Less is More.
Gaphor has only the most essential features, so users are not intimidated by a
baffling interface.

## Consistent.
UML is a graphical modeling language, so all information you put in the model
is visible in the diagrams. For example, stereotypes are modeled in diagrams.
There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it with Gaphor.

## Extensible.
Gaphor is built in Python and can be extended easily via "entry points".

## Have fun!
Learning should inspire fun - Gaphor helps learners quickly create models of
software and systems.

## Not Enterprise.
Sometimes enterprise software tries to do everything for everyone. We are
focused on the best possible experience for simple modeling and Gaphor is not a
full featured enterprise tool.
